Ingredients:

1 cup (180g) quinoa, rinsed
2 cups (480ml) water or vegetable broth
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
1 cucumber, diced
1 cup (150g) cherry tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup (40g) red onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup (15g) fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 cup (60ml) extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
Salt and pepper to taste
Crumbled feta cheese (optional, for serving)
Instructions:

In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, diced bell peppers, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and chopped parsley.

In a small bowl, whisk together the extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper to make the dressing.

Pour the dressing over the quinoa and vegetable mixture, then toss gently to coat everything evenly.

Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or lemon juice according to your preference.

Serve the veggie-packed quinoa salad at room temperature or chilled, garnished with crumbled feta cheese if desired. Enjoy this refreshing and nutritious dish!
